How do you calculate the minutes? Each call rounds up to the nearest second, and the time is accumulated. At the end of the month, we will charge you based on the total time. If someone is not talking during the call, will you still charge the fee? Yes, we calculate the entire length of the call because the speech-to-text module continues to operate throughout. How can I download the invoice and add company details? You can see the invoice after you paid the billing circle in the billing tab. Make sure you've added the company information before getting billed. More questions? Visit our docs Time to hire your AIÂ call center. Revolutionize your call operation with Retell.
